Fence Connect
=============

Allows fences to terminate against many solid nodes

By default, minetest game only lets fences terminate against wood or other fences. This mod adds a group, connect_to_fence, to many nodes used for building and adds that same group to all fences.

Edit the fence_connect.conf file to include nodes that you want fences to connect to.
